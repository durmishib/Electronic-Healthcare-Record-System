# Week 4 - Use Cases and Use Case Diagram for EHR System

## Overview

This folder, **week4**, contains detailed documentation of the use cases developed for the Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR) system, along with a comprehensive use case diagram. These documents are essential for understanding the functional requirements and expected interactions between users and the system.

## Contents

- **`UseCases.md`**: This Markdown file contains the detailed descriptions of all the use cases related to the EHR system. Each use case provides a clear explanation of the goals, main actors, preconditions, basic flow, alternative flows, and postconditions.

- **`UseCaseDiagram.png`**: A visual representation of the use cases in a diagrammatic form. This diagram illustrates the relationships between the actors and the use cases, providing a quick overview of the entire system's functionality.

## Use Case Overview

The use cases included in this folder cover a variety of functionalities crucial for an effective EHR system. Key functionalities documented include:
